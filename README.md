# 3 in 1 Game Program
Interactive games program with a graphical user interface (GUI) and computer AI.\
The Games Program project is an implementation of a fully-functioning two-player games
program, with all games being digital versions of well-known tabletop games.\
The program is a graphical program, presenting the user with visual menus and controls
enabling the user to play a game from the selection of games the program provides, choose
the game’s players (user or AI), and set the game’s difficulty.\
The program consists of 3 two-player games, all with perfect information, and each
providing the user with the option of selecting a user player or AI player for each of the two
players of the game.\
For AI, the minimax algorithm will be used. The same minimax algorithm is used for each
game, where only the scoring function will differ – specific to each game and its game state.\
The project provides a graphical user interface – such that the menus and controls for
each game will be represented graphically, and the user will be able to interact with it with
the keyboard and/or mouse.\
The games program will be a generic and modular program, containing code such that
games can be added and removed with minimal coding beyond that game’s specific logic.
